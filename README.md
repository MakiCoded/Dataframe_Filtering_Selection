**DataFrame Filtering Using loc and iloc in Pandas**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file, Dataframe_Filtering_using_loc_iloc.ipynb, 
which demonstrates techniques for filtering pandas DataFrames using the loc and iloc functions. 
These are essential for indexing and selecting data within DataFrames, providing a foundation for efficient data manipulation.

**Notebook Contents**
The notebook covers the following sections:

**Introduction to DataFrame Filtering**

Overview of filtering data in pandas DataFrames.
Explanation of loc (label-based indexing) and iloc (integer-based indexing).
Using loc for DataFrame Filtering

Examples of how to select rows and columns based on labels.
Conditional filtering with loc.
Using iloc for DataFrame Filtering

Selecting rows and columns based purely on their integer position.
Slicing and indexing examples for efficient data selection.
Combining loc and iloc for Complex Filters

Techniques for using both loc and iloc to achieve complex filters.
Best practices and tips for data selection in large datasets.
Running the Notebook
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to follow along with the examples and explanations.
Use Shift + Enter to run each cell and move to the next one.
Modify the code cells as needed to experiment with different filters and indexing techniques.
Additional Notes
For a more interactive experience, consider running this notebook in Google Colab (if using Google Colab, you can install pandas by running !pip install pandas in a code cell).
This notebook serves as a practical guide for learning how to filter and select data in pandas, and it is especially useful for beginners in data analysis or data science.
